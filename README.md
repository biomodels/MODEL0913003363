# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Mathematical modeling of calcium homeostasis in yeast cells.**   
Cui J, Kaandorp JA. _Cell Calcium_ 2006 Apr;39(4):337-48
[16445978](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16445978) ,  
**Abstract:**   
In this study, based on currently available experimental observations on
protein level, we constructed a mathematical model to describe calcium
homeostasis in normally growing yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
Simulation results show that tightly controlled low cytosolic calcium ion
level can be a natural result under the general mechanism of gene expression
feedback control. The calmodulin (a sensor protein) behavior in our model cell
agrees well with relevant observations in real cells. Moreover, our model can
qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed response curve of real
yeast cell responding to step-like disturbance in extracellular calcium ion
concentration. Further investigations show that the feedback control mechanism
in our model is as robust as it is in real cells.
